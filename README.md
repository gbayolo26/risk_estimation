# intervention_strategies
## Test allocation based on risk of infection from first and second order contact tracing for Covid-19

This code contains two interventions methods that combines testing, contact tracing, and quarantine to mitigate the propagation of Covid-19. For more information see paper (to put link here) 
 
 We evaluate interventions based on our risk ranking through simulations of a fairly realistic agent-based model calibrated for COVID-19 epidemic outbreak [ (the Oxford OpenABM model) ](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19). 
 This agent based model simulates the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a population with demographic structure based upon UK census data.  It has several implementations advantages, such as its level of detail and a very fast running time, even for large populations. 
 
 It permit to test containment strategies, in fact, contact tracing techniques such as the proposed can be easily integrated using the following link [https://github.com/aleingrosso/OpenABM-Covid19](https://github.com/aleingrosso/OpenABM-Covid19).
